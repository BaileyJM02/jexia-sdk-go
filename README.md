Jexia SDK Go is an unofficial multi-level API wrapper for Jexia's API written in Go for interacting with Jexia projects. The aims of this project are to support everything Jexia's [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/jexia/jexia-sdk-js) currently does, but in a way friendly to the Go eco-system.

> This project is still in the very early stages, breaking changes may be introduced until v0.1.0 stable. After this, new features and bug fixes will be implemented. We aim to follow the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) specification.
